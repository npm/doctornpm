title: About doctornpm
---

doctornpm is a gatsby theme based on the very fine
[doctocat](https://primer.style/doctocat) theme, which is part
of [Primer](https://primer.style/), GitHub's design system.

It's been modified to add some of the look and feel of
[npm](https://npmjs.com/), and includes a number of pieces of
functionality to support the npm documentation:

* Expanding navigation sidebar
  There's a lot of pages on the npm documentation site!  The navigation
  sidebar will only expand to the section that you're in, and will only
  show the top-level navigation elements for everything else.  This
  should try to keep from overwhelming you.

* "Variants" in navigation
  In order to support multiple versions of the CLI documentation
  (since npm v6 and npm v7 are both in frequent use) we've added
  what we call "variants" in the navigation hierarchy, so that you
  can view the npm v6 docs _or_ the npm v7 docs.

* `slug` is configurable
  The slug (the resulting page name or URL) is configurable in a
  document's frontmatter.  This may be helpful for sites that have
  a "legacy" URL layout.

* GitHub repository, branch, file path, and the option are configurable
  for "Edit this page on GitHub" on a per-page basis using frontmatter.
  This may be helpful for sites that spread their documentation across
  multiple repositories.  (In particular, the npm registry documentation
  lives in one repository and the npm CLI documentation lives with the CLI
  itself.)

  ```yaml
  ---
  github_repo: ''
  github_branch: ''
  github_path: ''
  ---
  ```

* Make GitHub integration optional
  Although we definitely want to display the contributors list and
  an "Edit on GitHub link", we needed to publish the new
  [docs.npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/) before we had finalized
  updating the documentation in the CLI.  As a result, we didn't want
  to link people to the wrong places, so we added an opt-out.

  This can be controlled globally using `editOnGitHub` in the plugin's
  config, or on a per-page basis with the `edit_on_github` frontmatter.
